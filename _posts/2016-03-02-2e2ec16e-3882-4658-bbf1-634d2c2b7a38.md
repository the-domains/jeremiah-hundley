Keeping the body healthy, the mind strong and the will to achieve my goals is a daily struggle. Life throws curveballs at you. Sometimes, it feels like there's something, deep, festering in the bowels of the mundane, that wants me to fail. I bet I'm not the only one. Then I realize, that most of the time, my failures can be traced back to my inactions.
